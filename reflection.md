# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**
1. The user can schedule taks such as, walking, feeding, and medication.
2. The user can add pets and store their basic information.
3. The user can view their daily schedules and track completed tasks.

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
My initial UML design includes four(4) main classes:
Owner, Pet, Task, and Scheduler; Owner class stores information about the pet owner, and manages their pet. The Task class represents activities such as feeding and walking, including their rueation, priority, and completion status. The Scheduler class organizes tasks by time, filter tasks, and detects scheduling conflicts. The Pet class stores a list of tasks and basic pet information.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each? I made a change to my initial UML design by a due_date attribute to the Task class. I did this so the Scheduler can distinguish tasks scheduled at the same time on different days. This will help the system manage daily and weekly tasks.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
